## Overview

<!-- write sentences like this for each skill you want assessed (of those eligible for this check) -->
I've demonstrated skills python in by having my memory refreshed on how python works. I always thought python was the easiest language to use because of how straightforward it is and less difficult. 


## Reflection

I did not run into too many challenges other than learning how to create files and save them in Jupyter Lab.
